Revolutionary stuff. Really gets the heart racing.\n\nOh, and the **ticket prices**! At only ¬£50-150+ per match, it's so accessible to the working-class supporters who built these clubs. Who needs to feed their family when you can watch your team lose 3-0 to a newly promoted side?\n\nBut hey, at least we get **80+ matches per season** to watch the same teams play each other repeatedly.

Nothing says \"relaxing vacation\" like navigating the world's busiest train station during rush hour while being gently compressed by salarymen like a human accordion.\n\nAnd the food? *Chef's kiss* ‚Äì overpriced, tiny portions that'll leave you wondering if you actually ate or just looked at food for three hours. But hey, at least you can pay $300 for a bowl of ramen that tastes like it was blessed by a Michelin-star chef's distant cousin.\n\nThe weather is also *delightful*‚Äîeither you're melting in 95-degree humidity that makes you question your life choices, or it's so cold your tears freeze before they hit your cheeks. No in-between!\n\nBut sure, Tokyo is definitely the place to go if you love crowds, neon signs, vending machines on every corner, and the constant feeling that you're somehow both completely lost and exactly where you need to be.\n\n*Truly magical.* üôÑ",
